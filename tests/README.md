# Tests

This directory will host tests that:

1) check that output file is created;
2) check md5 hashsum to confirm that target file has changed;
3) check the row length of source and target files;
4) sample source and target hashes for integrity.

More test ideas to follow :). Would also like to check out PyTest.
